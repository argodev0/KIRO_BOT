- Comprehensive security monitoring

## üìä Security Validation Results

All security validations passed with 100% success rate:

- **Password Security**: 4/4 passed
- **Encryption Security**: 5/5 passed  
- **Monitoring Security**: 5/5 passed
- **Security Hardening**: 7/7 passed
- **Audit Security**: 5/5 passed
- **Paper Trading Security**: 7/7 passed

**Overall Security Score: 33/33 (100%)**

## üîê Security Features Implemented

### Cryptographic Security
- All passwords meet complexity requirements (16+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- All encryption keys are 256-bit minimum (AES-256 compatible)
- JWT secrets use 512-bit keys for maximum security
- Cryptographically secure random generation for all secrets

### Access Control
- File permissions set to 600 (owner read/write only)
- Secure environment variable management
- API key encryption and secure storage
- Session management with secure cookies

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Real-time security event monitoring
- Automated threat detection and response
- Comprehensive audit logging with encryption
- Security dashboard and metrics collection

### Paper Trading Safety
- Multiple layers of paper trading enforcement
- Real trading endpoints completely blocked
- API key validation for read-only permissions
- Continuous safety validation

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `scripts/security-configuration.js` - Main security configuration script
- `scripts/validate-security-configuration.js` - Security validation tool
- `scripts/generate-production-secrets.js` - Secrets generation utility
