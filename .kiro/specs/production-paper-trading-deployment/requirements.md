# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the KIRO_BOT system into a production-ready paper trading platform that provides real-time market data from mainnet exchanges while ensuring zero financial risk through comprehensive paper trading safeguards. The system will include professional-grade infrastructure, monitoring, security, and a public-accessible web application with SSL/domain configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to access a production-ready paper trading system with live mainnet data, so that I can practice trading strategies without financial risk while experiencing real market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL connect to Binance and KuCoin mainnet APIs for real-time market data
2. WHEN any trading operation is attempted THEN the system SHALL execute only paper trades with virtual balances
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL validate that paper trading mode is enforced at all system levels
4. IF real trading is attempted THEN the system SHALL block the operation and log a security alert
5. WHEN displaying market data THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate "LIVE MAINNET DATA" source
6. WHEN executing paper trades THEN the system SHALL simulate realistic market conditions including slippage and fees
7. WHEN hosting the webapp on localhost THEN it SHALL display all elements without error and be fully functional

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive production infrastructure with security, monitoring, and SSL, so that the system is reliable, secure, and professionally accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL use Docker containers with health checks and restart policies
2. WHEN accessing the application THEN it SHALL be available via HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL configure Nginx reverse proxy for frontend and API routing
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN it SHALL provide Prometheus metrics, health endpoints, and log aggregation
5. WHEN securing the system THEN it SHALL implement firewall rules, fail2ban, and rate limiting
6. IF system components fail THEN automated health checks SHALL detect and restart failed services
7. WHEN backing up data THEN the system SHALL perform automated database backups with retention policies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage and safety mechanisms, so that I can ensure the paper trading system never executes real trades and all components function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL include unit, integration, and end-to-end test suites
2. WHEN testing trading functionality THEN tests SHALL verify that only paper trades are executed
3. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN tests SHALL validate that real trading operations are blocked
4. WHEN testing the frontend THEN tests SHALL verify paper trading mode indicators are displayed
5. WHEN validating API keys THEN the system SHALL ensure only READ-ONLY permissions are used
6. IF API keys have trading permissions THEN the system SHALL reject them and throw security errors
7. WHEN running the test suite THEN all critical safety mechanisms SHALL be validated

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want a professional web application with real-time charts and trading interface, so that I can analyze markets and execute paper trades through an intuitive dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web application THEN it SHALL display real-time market data with WebSocket connections
2. WHEN viewing charts THEN the system SHALL integrate TradingView charts with live candlestick data
3. WHEN using the trading interface THEN it SHALL clearly display "PAPER TRADING MODE" warnings
4. WHEN placing orders THEN the interface SHALL require confirmation for paper trade execution
5. WHEN viewing portfolio THEN it SHALL display virtual balances and simulated trade history
6. WHEN analyzing markets THEN the system SHALL provide technical indicators (RSI, Elliott Wave, Fibonacci)
7. WHEN the connection status changes THEN the UI SHALL display real-time connection indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want automated deployment scripts and monitoring dashboards, so that I can deploy, monitor, and maintain the production system efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use automated deployment scripts with health verification
2. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL provide Grafana dashboards for system metrics
3. WHEN checking system health THEN endpoints SHALL return comprehensive status information
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL send automated alerts and notifications
5. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling with load balancing
6. IF database issues occur THEN automated backup and recovery procedures SHALL be available
7. WHEN maintaining THEN the system SHALL provide runbooks and operational procedures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want multiple layers of paper trading protection, so that I can be absolutely certain no real money is at risk during system operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL validate paper trading mode at application startup
2. WHEN processing orders THEN middleware SHALL intercept and convert all trades to paper trades
3. WHEN using exchange APIs THEN the system SHALL only use READ-ONLY API permissions
4. WHEN attempting withdrawals or transfers THEN the system SHALL block all real money operations
5. WHEN logging trades THEN all paper trade executions SHALL be clearly marked and audited
6. IF paper trading mode is disabled THEN the system SHALL refuse to start and throw critical errors
7. WHEN displaying UI elements THEN paper trading indicators SHALL be prominently visible

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want optimized real-time data processing and responsive user interface, so that I can make trading decisions based on current market conditions without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming market data THEN the system SHALL maintain WebSocket connections with <100ms latency
2. WHEN loading pages THEN the application SHALL achieve <2 second load times
3. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL handle multiple symbol subscriptions simultaneously
4. WHEN displaying charts THEN updates SHALL render smoothly without blocking the UI
5. WHEN scaling users THEN the system SHALL support concurrent connections with rate limiting
6. IF data feeds disconnect THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and resume streaming
7. WHEN caching data THEN Redis SHALL be used for high-performance data storage and retrieval
