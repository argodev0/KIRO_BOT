# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Crypto Trading Bot project has been developed but faces critical deployment issues that prevent successful production launch. Analysis of test reports reveals 14 critical issues, including paper trading safety failures, missing dependencies, configuration problems, and integration failures. This feature addresses all deployment blockers and ensures the website functions properly with live market data and secure paper trading functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Critical Paper Trading Safety Fixes

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all paper trading safety mechanisms to be properly implemented and validated, so that real trading is completely blocked and the system operates safely in paper trading mode only.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the environment variable TRADING_SIMULATION_ONLY SHALL be set to true
2. WHEN any trading operation is attempted THEN the paper trading guard SHALL block real trades and throw errors for unsafe operations
3. WHEN API keys are configured THEN they SHALL be read-only keys that cannot execute real trades
4. WHEN the paper trading safety score is calculated THEN it SHALL be above 90%
5. IF real trading code patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment
6. WHEN virtual balance handling is implemented THEN it SHALL properly simulate trades without real money

### Requirement 2: Missing Dependencies and Build Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all required dependencies to be properly installed and configured, so that the application builds and runs without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN all TypeScript compilation errors SHALL be resolved
2. WHEN dependencies are checked THEN Prisma SHALL be properly installed and configured
3. WHEN Jest tests are run THEN the test framework SHALL be properly installed and functional
4. WHEN Docker images are built THEN they SHALL build successfully without errors
5. WHEN the production environment is validated THEN all required files SHALL be present

### Requirement 3: Environment Configuration and Docker Setup

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the production environment to be properly configured with all necessary files and settings, so that the application can be deployed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN production deployment is initiated THEN docker-compose.prod.yml SHALL be present and valid
2. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN MONITORING_ENABLED SHALL be set to true in environment
3. WHEN SSL is configured THEN all SSL certificates and configurations SHALL be properly set up
4. WHEN database connections are tested THEN they SHALL connect successfully
5. WHEN Redis and RabbitMQ are started THEN they SHALL be accessible and functional

### Requirement 4: Live Market Data Integration

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to receive and process live market data from exchanges, so that I can see real-time price information and technical analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system connects to Binance THEN it SHALL receive real-time price data via WebSocket
2. WHEN the system connects to KuCoin THEN it SHALL receive real-time market data
3. WHEN market data is processed THEN it SHALL be stored in Redis cache for fast access
4. WHEN technical indicators are calculated THEN they SHALL use live market data
5. WHEN the frontend loads THEN it SHALL display real-time price charts and data
6. WHEN WebSocket connections fail THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect

### Requirement 5: Frontend Functionality and User Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a fully functional web interface that displays live trading data and allows me to configure the bot, so that I can monitor and control the trading system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the website THEN it SHALL load without errors and display the dashboard
2. WHEN live data is received THEN the charts SHALL update in real-time
3. WHEN I configure bot settings THEN the changes SHALL be saved and applied
4. WHEN I view trading history THEN it SHALL show all paper trades executed
5. WHEN I check portfolio status THEN it SHALL display virtual balances and P&L
6. WHEN the system is in paper trading mode THEN clear indicators SHALL show this status

### Requirement 6: API Endpoints and WebSocket Functionality

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want all API endpoints to be functional and WebSocket connections to work properly, so that I can communicate with the backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL return proper responses without errors
2. WHEN WebSocket connections are established THEN they SHALL maintain stable connections
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN JWT tokens SHALL be properly validated
4. WHEN rate limiting is applied THEN it SHALL prevent abuse while allowing normal usage
5. WHEN health checks are performed THEN all services SHALL report healthy status

### Requirement 7: Production Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting to be functional, so that I can track system health and performance in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Prometheus is started THEN it SHALL collect metrics from all services
2. WHEN Grafana is accessed THEN it SHALL display all configured dashboards
3. WHEN critical issues occur THEN alerts SHALL be sent to administrators
4. WHEN system performance degrades THEN monitoring SHALL detect and report issues
5. WHEN logs are generated THEN they SHALL be properly formatted and stored

### Requirement 8: Integration Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want all integration tests to pass and system validation to be successful, so that I can confirm the system is ready for production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests are run THEN they SHALL all pass without critical failures
2. WHEN end-to-end workflows are tested THEN they SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN load testing is performed THEN the system SHALL handle expected traffic
4. WHEN security testing is conducted THEN no critical vulnerabilities SHALL be found
5. WHEN smoke tests are executed THEN all core functionality SHALL be operational
