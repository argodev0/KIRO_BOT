# Production Deployment Execution - Implementation Plan

## Phase Overview
This phase executes the production deployment of the paper trading system. All development work has been completed, and now we focus on environment preparation, deployment execution, and operational validation.

## Current Status
**DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED** - Critical environment issues must be resolved:
- ❌ Node.js version v12.22.9 (requires >=18.0.0)
- ❌ Docker not installed (required for containerized deployment)
- ❌ Dependencies failed to install due to Node.js version incompatibility
