# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This phase focuses on the actual production deployment and operational validation of the paper trading system. All development work has been completed, and now we need to execute the deployment process, validate the production environment, and ensure the system is fully operational with all safety mechanisms active.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to prepare the production environment with proper Node.js version and dependencies, so that the application can run with full compatibility and all features enabled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading the environment THEN Node.js version SHALL be >=18.0.0 for full dependency compatibility
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN npm install SHALL complete successfully without compatibility errors
3. WHEN validating the environment THEN all required system dependencies SHALL be available and functional
4. WHEN checking package integrity THEN all security vulnerabilities SHALL be resolved or acceptable
5. WHEN testing basic functionality THEN the application SHALL start without critical errors
6. WHEN verifying TypeScript compilation THEN the build process SHALL complete successfully
7. WHEN running basic tests THEN core functionality SHALL be validated before deployment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want to configure the production environment variables and secrets, so that the application runs securely with proper paper trading enforcement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up environment variables THEN production configuration SHALL enforce paper trading mode
2. WHEN configuring API keys THEN only read-only exchange API keys SHALL be accepted
3. WHEN setting database connections THEN production database SHALL be properly configured and accessible
4. WHEN configuring SSL certificates THEN HTTPS SHALL be properly enabled with valid certificates
5. WHEN setting up monitoring THEN Prometheus and Grafana SHALL have proper access credentials
6. WHEN configuring security settings THEN all security hardening options SHALL be enabled
7. WHEN validating configuration THEN paper trading safety SHALL be confirmed at environment level

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to run comprehensive pre-deployment testing, so that I can ensure all systems work correctly before going live.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN all tests SHALL pass with 100% success rate
2. WHEN executing integration tests THEN all service integrations SHALL function correctly
3. WHEN performing security tests THEN all security mechanisms SHALL be validated
4. WHEN testing paper trading safety THEN no real trading operations SHALL be possible
5. WHEN validating API connections THEN live market data SHALL stream correctly
6. WHEN testing frontend functionality THEN all UI components SHALL render and function properly
7. WHEN running performance tests THEN system SHALL meet all performance benchmarks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the production infrastructure using Docker containers, so that the system runs reliably with proper isolation and scalability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building Docker images THEN all containers SHALL build successfully without errors
2. WHEN starting containers THEN all services SHALL start and pass health checks
3. WHEN configuring networking THEN container communication SHALL work properly
4. WHEN setting up volumes THEN data persistence SHALL be properly configured
5. WHEN deploying with docker-compose THEN the entire stack SHALL come up successfully
6. WHEN checking container status THEN all containers SHALL be running and healthy
7. WHEN testing container restart THEN services SHALL recover automatically from failures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to validate that all security measures are active in production, so that the system is protected against threats and unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing SSL/TLS THEN HTTPS connections SHALL be properly encrypted and validated
2. WHEN checking rate limiting THEN API endpoints SHALL properly throttle excessive requests
3. WHEN validating input sanitization THEN malicious inputs SHALL be properly blocked
4. WHEN testing authentication THEN only authorized users SHALL have access
5. WHEN checking audit logging THEN all security events SHALL be properly logged
6. WHEN validating firewall rules THEN only necessary ports SHALL be accessible
7. WHEN testing intrusion detection THEN suspicious activities SHALL trigger appropriate alerts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a monitoring specialist, I want to verify that all monitoring and alerting systems are operational, so that I can detect and respond to issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking Prometheus metrics THEN all system metrics SHALL be collected and available
2. WHEN validating Grafana dashboards THEN all visualizations SHALL display correct data
3. WHEN testing health endpoints THEN all health checks SHALL respond with accurate status
4. WHEN triggering test alerts THEN notification systems SHALL deliver alerts properly
5. WHEN monitoring system performance THEN all performance metrics SHALL be within acceptable ranges
6. WHEN checking log aggregation THEN all application logs SHALL be properly collected and searchable
7. WHEN validating uptime monitoring THEN system availability SHALL be continuously tracked

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want to perform comprehensive post-deployment validation, so that I can confirm the system is fully operational and ready for users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the web interface SHALL be fully functional and responsive
2. WHEN testing paper trading operations THEN all trades SHALL be properly simulated without real money risk
3. WHEN validating real-time data THEN live market data SHALL stream correctly from exchanges
4. WHEN checking user workflows THEN all critical user journeys SHALL work end-to-end
5. WHEN testing system recovery THEN the system SHALL handle failures gracefully and recover automatically
6. WHEN validating performance THEN response times SHALL meet all specified benchmarks
7. WHEN confirming compliance THEN all paper trading safety measures SHALL be active and auditable
