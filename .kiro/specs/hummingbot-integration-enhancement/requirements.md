### Requirement 5: Enhanced Safety and Compliance

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want enhanced safety measures and audit capabilities for Hummingbot integration, so that all trading activities are properly monitored and controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Hummingbot strategies are executed THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive audit logs of all activities
2. WHEN paper trading mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL prevent Hummingbot from executing real trades
3. WHEN risk limits are approached THEN the system SHALL automatically pause or adjust Hummingbot strategies
4. IF suspicious trading patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and halt operations
5. WHEN compliance reports are generated THEN they SHALL include detailed Hummingbot execution data
6. WHEN system recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL ensure Hummingbot strategies are properly synchronized

### Requirement 6: Performance Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want detailed monitoring and analytics for Hummingbot integration, so that I can optimize trading performance and identify improvement opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Hummingbot strategies execute THEN the system SHALL track execution latency, slippage, and fill rates
2. WHEN performance analysis is conducted THEN the system SHALL compare direct execution vs Hummingbot execution
3. WHEN optimization opportunities are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest strategy parameter adjustments
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert users and suggest corrective actions
5. WHEN reporting is generated THEN it SHALL include comprehensive Hummingbot-specific metrics
6. WHEN backtesting is performed THEN it SHALL simulate both direct and Hummingbot execution scenarios

### Requirement 7: Multi-Exchange Coordination

**User Story:** As a multi-exchange trader, I want coordinated Hummingbot strategies across Binance and KuCoin, so that I can optimize execution across different liquidity pools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN strategies span multiple exchanges THEN the system SHALL coordinate Hummingbot instances appropriately
2. WHEN arbitrage opportunities are detected THEN the system SHALL configure cross-exchange Hummingbot strategies
3. WHEN exchange-specific conditions change THEN the system SHALL adjust strategies per exchange independently
