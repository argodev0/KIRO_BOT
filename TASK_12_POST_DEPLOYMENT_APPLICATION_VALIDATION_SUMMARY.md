- User authentication workflow validation
- Portfolio management workflow testing
- System recovery and health endpoint validation
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Validation (All Tests)
```bash
node scripts/post-deployment-application-validation.js
```

### Selective Testing
```bash
# Skip frontend tests
node scripts/post-deployment-application-validation.js --skip-frontend

# Skip market data tests
node scripts/post-deployment-application-validation.js --skip-market-data

# Custom URLs
node scripts/post-deployment-application-validation.js \
  --base-url https://api.myapp.com \
  --frontend-url https://app.myapp.com
```

### Test the Validation Framework
```bash
node scripts/test-post-deployment-validation.js
```

## Report Generation

### Comprehensive JSON Report
The validation generates a detailed JSON report (`post-deployment-application-validation-report.json`) containing:

```json

## Safety and Security Focus

### Paper Trading Safety Validation
- **Environment Variable Validation**: Ensures `PAPER_TRADING_MODE=true` and `ALLOW_REAL_TRADES=false`
- **API Key Validation**: Verifies only read-only API keys are configured
- **Trade Blocking**: Tests that real money trades are blocked
- **Virtual Portfolio**: Validates virtual portfolio operations
- **Safety Score Calculation**: Comprehensive safety scoring system

### Security Measures
- **Input Validation**: All API endpoints tested for proper input handling
- **Authentication Testing**: Validates authentication and authorization flows
- **Rate Limiting**: Tests API rate limiting functionality
- **Error Handling**: Validates proper error handling and logging

## Performance Validation

### Response Time Requirements
- API endpoints must respond within 200ms
- WebSocket connections must establish within 5 seconds
- Market data must be fresh (< 60 seconds old)
- Complete workflows must complete within 30 seconds

### Load Testing Integration
- Concurrent request handling validation
- WebSocket connection stability testing
- Market data throughput validation
- System resource utilization monitoring

## Integration with Deployment Pipeline

### Exit Codes
- **0**: All validations passed - safe to proceed
- **1**: Non-critical failures - review recommended
- **2**: Critical failures - DO NOT DEPLOY

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# In deployment pipeline
./scripts/post-deployment-application-validation.js
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "‚úÖ Post-deployment validation passed - deployment successful"
else
  echo "‚ùå Post-deployment validation failed - rolling back"
