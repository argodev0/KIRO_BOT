## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### For System Administrator/DevOps Engineer:

1. **Resolve Environment Issues** (Required before proceeding)
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Use automated setup script
   ./scripts/setup-environment.sh
   
   # Option 2: Manual installation following the guide
   # See docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Resolution**
   ```bash
   # Re-run environment preparation after fixes
   node scripts/environment-preparation.js
   
   # Expected: All 21 checks should pass (100% success rate)
   ```

3. **Proceed to Task 2** (Once environment is ready)
   - Dependency installation and package validation
   - Security audit and vulnerability resolution
   - TypeScript compilation validation

### Critical Requirements for Progression:
- ✅ Node.js version >=18.0.0
- ✅ Docker Engine installed and running
- ✅ Docker Compose available
- ✅ All environment preparation checks passing
