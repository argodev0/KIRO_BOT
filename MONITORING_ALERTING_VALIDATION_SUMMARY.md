## Monitoring Components Overview

### Prometheus Configuration
```yaml
# Key scrape targets configured:
- trading-bot-backend:3000 (10s interval)
- node-exporter:9100 (system metrics)
- cadvisor:8080 (container metrics)
- postgres-exporter:9187 (database metrics)
- redis-exporter:9121 (cache metrics)
- nginx-exporter:9113 (web server metrics)
- Exchange APIs monitoring via blackbox exporter
```

### AlertManager Routing
```yaml
# Notification channels configured:
- Email notifications (multiple severity levels)
- Slack integration (critical alerts)
- Webhook notifications (SMS for critical)
- Business hours routing for non-critical alerts
```

### Grafana Dashboards
- **System Metrics:** CPU, memory, disk, network monitoring
- **Trading Metrics:** Trade execution, signal generation, P&L tracking
- **Performance Analytics:** Latency, throughput, error rates
- **Paper Trading Safety:** Safety score, virtual balance tracking
- **Real-time Data Feeds:** Market data quality and latency

## Validation Scripts Created

### 1. `validate-monitoring-components.js`

- Monitoring service functionality testing
- Alert rules and dashboard validation
- **Result:** All components properly configured

### 2. `test-health-endpoints-comprehensive.js`
- Application startup and health endpoint testing
- Metrics endpoint validation
- Error handling verification
- **Result:** Ready for manual testing

### 3. `validate-monitoring-system-complete.js`
- Complete end-to-end validation orchestrator
- Comprehensive reporting and recommendations
- **Result:** System ready for deployment

## Deployment Readiness

### ‚úÖ Ready Components
- All monitoring configuration files validated
- Alert rules properly structured and comprehensive
- Grafana dashboards configured with appropriate panels
