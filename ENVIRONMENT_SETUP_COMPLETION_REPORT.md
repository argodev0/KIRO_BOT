   - Tests all installations after session restart

5. **`ENVIRONMENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md`**
   - Comprehensive setup documentation
   - Manual and automated installation options
   - Troubleshooting guide

### Installation Process

The environment was successfully upgraded using the following process:

1. **Initial Assessment**
   ```bash
   node scripts/environment-preparation-comprehensive.js
   ```
   - Identified Node.js v12.22.9 (incompatible)
   - Confirmed Docker not installed
   - Created environment backup

2. **Node.js Upgrade**
   ```bash
   # Removed conflicting packages
   sudo apt-get remove --purge nodejs npm libnode-dev
   sudo apt autoremove -y
   
   # Added NodeSource repository
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
   
   # Installed Node.js 18
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   ```

3. **Docker Installation**
   ```bash
   # Added Docker repository
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
   
   # Installed Docker CE
   sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
   
   # Configured user permissions
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```

## Current Status

### ✅ Ready Components
- Node.js v18.20.8 (✅ Compatible)
- npm v10.8.2 (✅ Functional)
- Docker v28.3.3 (✅ Installed)
- Docker Compose v2.39.1 (✅ Available)
- System Resources (✅ Adequate)
- Project Structure (✅ Complete)

### ⚠️ Pending Action
- **Docker Group Membership**: Requires session restart to take effect
  - User has been added to docker group
  - Must log out and log back in for changes to activate
  - Run `./post-install-validation.sh` after session restart

## Validation Results

### Pre-Session Restart
```
Total Validations: 6
Passed: 4
Failed: 2 (Docker permissions - expected)
Warnings: 1
```

### Expected Post-Session Restart
```
Total Validations: 6
Passed: 6
Failed: 0
Warnings: 0
Status: ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (requires session restart):
   ```bash
   # Log out and log back in, then run:
   ./post-install-validation.sh
   node scripts/validate-environment-readiness.js
   ```

2. **Dependency Installation**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.production.template .env.production
   # Edit .env.production with actual values
   ```

4. **Pre-deployment Testing**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run test:integration
   ```

5. **Production Deployment**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-production.sh
   ```
