## Validation Scripts

Two comprehensive validation scripts have been created:

1. **`scripts/validate-production-environment.js`** - Core environment validation
2. **`scripts/production-deployment-readiness.js`** - Deployment readiness assessment

Both scripts can be run at any time to re-validate the production environment.
