3. **Probability Threshold Analysis**: Uses NKN and technical analysis for probability-based triggers
4. **Dynamic Hedge Ratio Calculation**: Adjusts hedge ratios based on:
   - Market volatility
   - Position correlation
   - Current performance
   - Risk metrics

### Perpetual Futures Contract Management

The perpetual futures management system provides:

1. **Leverage Optimization**:
   - Calculates optimal leverage based on target volatility
   - Adjusts for risk tolerance and market conditions
   - Monitors and adjusts leverage dynamically

2. **Funding Rate Optimization**:
   - Monitors funding rates across all positions
   - Reduces positions when funding costs are high
   - Alerts on upcoming funding rate changes
   - Optimizes position timing around funding periods

3. **Risk Management**:
   - Position size limits enforcement
   - Liquidation risk monitoring with automatic position reduction
   - Margin ratio monitoring
   - Comprehensive risk scoring

### Position Correlation Analysis

The correlation analysis system:

1. **Calculates Correlations**: Uses price history to determine correlations between trading pairs
2. **Determines Hedge Ratios**: Calculates optimal hedge ratios using linear regression
3. **Measures Effectiveness**: Evaluates hedge effectiveness through variance reduction
4. **Dynamic Updates**: Continuously updates correlations based on market conditions

### Dynamic Hedge Adjustment

The dynamic adjustment system:

1. **Market Condition Monitoring**: Continuously monitors volatility and trend changes
2. **Performance-Based Adjustments**: Adjusts hedge sizes based on current performance
3. **Correlation-Based Optimization**: Uses real-time correlation data for optimization
4. **Risk-Adjusted Sizing**: Adjusts hedge sizes based on risk metrics
