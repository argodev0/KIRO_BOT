**Key Features:**
- Connection activity monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Health status reporting
- Configurable monitoring intervals
- Automatic connection registration

### 4. Enhanced WebSocket Server Integration
Updated the main WebSocket server (`WebSocketServer.ts`) to integrate stability features:

- **Stability Manager Integration**: Automatic registration of new connections
- **Activity Tracking**: Updates stability manager on message activity
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling with stability tracking
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Enhanced shutdown process with stability service cleanup

## API Enhancements

### New WebSocket Server Methods
- `getStabilityReport()`: Get comprehensive stability metrics
- `getRecoveryStats()`: Get connection recovery statistics
- `shutdown()`: Enhanced graceful shutdown with stability cleanup

### New Events Emitted
- `connectionRecovered`: When a connection is successfully recovered
- `unhealthyConnection`: When a connection becomes unhealthy
- `staleConnection`: When a connection becomes stale
- `stabilityAlert`: When stability metrics indicate issues
- `circuitBreakerOpened`: When circuit breaker opens for a connection

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Stability Metrics Available
- Total connections count
- Healthy vs unhealthy connections
- Stale connection detection
